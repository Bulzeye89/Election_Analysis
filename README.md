## Overview of Election Audit
### Background 
A Colorado Board of Elections employee had initially given me the follwing tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

After completing this, the election commission made a secondary request to complete the audit.  The additional data they have requested is:
1. The voter turnout for each county
2. The percentages of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout
